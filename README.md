# Swift VIP Architecture Project

This project is built using the **VIP (View, Interactor, Presenter)** architecture pattern, incorporating **UIKit** for UI components, along with **Routers** and **Workers** for better separation of concerns and handling different functionalities.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of View, Interactor, and Presenter layers.
- **Router:** Manages navigation and routing logic between scenes.
- **Workers:** Perform data fetching or other business logic, separate from the Interactor.
- **UIKit:** Used to build the user interface for iOS devices.

## VIP Architecture Overview

The VIP architecture follows the **clean architecture** principles and separates the app into distinct layers:

1. **View (UI Layer):** 
   - The View is responsible for displaying the data provided by the Presenter.
   - It listens to user interactions and forwards them to the Interactor.
   
2. **Interactor (Business Logic Layer):**
   - Handles the app's business logic.
   - Receives user inputs from the View and processes them.
   - Interacts with Workers to perform tasks, such as fetching data or making API calls.
   - Passes the results back to the Presenter.

3. **Presenter (Presentation Logic Layer):**
   - Receives data from the Interactor and formats it for display in the View.
   - Decides what information the View should display and how it should be presented.

4. **Router (Navigation Logic Layer):**
   - Responsible for handling transitions between screens.
   - Decouples navigation logic from the ViewController to ensure maintainability.

5. **Workers:**
   - Perform tasks requested by the Interactor, such as making network requests or interacting with a database.
   - Allow separation of complex tasks from the Interactor to keep it lightweight.
